Caled is a visual editor for LUT calibration files that uses dispwin to upload and download the LUTs
It will display a simple black to white gradient,
your task is to modify the r,g,b curves until you will see a perfect gray gradient without color casts.
It doesn't expect to be a replacement for hardware calibrators, but i've had success in calibrating several
cheap notebooks displays.

It is all up to you and your eyes!

Caled is written and requires (the latest) Gambas3:
http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html


Usage is preatty simple, just drag the cursors with the mouse.
Up/Down:    will modify the brightness
Left/right: will change the range of the operator
The operators can be selected by the dropdown combobox in the bottom/left corner.
The display combobox will indicate which monitor you are changing.

You can load and save different calibration files.
To apply them, just use dispwin <calibration file>
